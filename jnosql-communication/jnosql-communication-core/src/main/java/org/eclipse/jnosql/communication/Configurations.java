/**
 * This enum contains common configurations that are frequently used for NoSQL databases.
 * It provides a standardized way to retrieve configuration keys using the {@link Supplier} interface,
 * which allows these properties to be fetched dynamically in different contexts.
 *
 * <p>Each constant in this enum represents a specific configuration option, such as connection details
 * (user, password, host) or other database-related settings (like encryption and pagination behavior).
 * By implementing {@link Supplier}, each enum constant can supply the associated property value directly
 * via the {@link #get()} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>Developers can reference these constants throughout the application to avoid hardcoding configuration
 * keys and ensure consistent access to NoSQL database properties. This is particularly useful for managing
 * complex or large-scale database configurations where multiple properties (e.g., hosts, pagination settings)
 * are involved.</p>
